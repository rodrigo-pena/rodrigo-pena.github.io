# About

I am currently a Ph.D student in Computer Science at [EPFL][epfl], doing research on recovery algorithms for subsampled graph signals. My studies were mostly funded by the European Unionâ€™s *Marie Curie ITN* [SpaRTaN][spartan].

I was born and raised on a [modernist island][brasilia] in the dry Brazilian highlands.
