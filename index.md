# About me

During my doctoral studies, I did research on recovery algorithms for subsampled graph signals. I was mostly funded by the European Unionâ€™s *Marie Curie ITN* [SpaRTaN][spartan].

I grew up in an [outlier modernist city][brasilia] in the dry Brazilian highlands.

For more information, such as list of publications and code repositories, please check the links in the bottom of this page. Feel free to send me an email if you want to discuss anything.
