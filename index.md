# About me

- I grew up in an [outlier modernist city][brasilia] in the dry Brazilian highlands.

- While at EPFL, I investigated recovery algorithms for subsampled graph signals. My doctoral studies were mostly funded by the European Unionâ€™s *Marie Curie ITN* [SpaRTaN][spartan].

- For more information, such as list of publications and code repositories, please check the links below. Feel free to send me an email.
