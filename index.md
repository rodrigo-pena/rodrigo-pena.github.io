# Updates

- I started working as a Data Analyst at [CeDa](https://ceda.unibas.ch/), the Center for Data Analytics at the University of Basel.


# About me

- I grew up in an [outlier modernist city][brasilia] in the dry Brazilian highlands.

- I did my Ph.D. at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausane [(EPFL)][epfl]. The thesis is freely available online at [http://dx.doi.org/10.5075/epfl-thesis-7219](http://dx.doi.org/10.5075/epfl-thesis-7219). While at EPFL, I investigated recovery algorithms for subsampled graph signals. My doctoral studies were mostly funded by the European Union’s *Marie Curie ITN* [SpaRTaN][spartan].
