# About

**News:** I have successfully defended my Ph.D. at [EPFL][epfl]. The thesis is freely available online at [http://dx.doi.org/10.5075/epfl-thesis-7219](http://dx.doi.org/10.5075/epfl-thesis-7219).

During my doctoral studies, I did research on recovery algorithms for subsampled graph signals. I was mostly funded by the European Unionâ€™s *Marie Curie ITN* [SpaRTaN][spartan].

I grew up in an [outlier modernist city][brasilia] in the dry Brazilian highlands.
